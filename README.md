## Coffee Shop App - With Expo React Native

My project is a full-stack React Native application featuring user authentication, order history, an advanced cart system, and a favorites screen. It seamlessly integrates a Node.js backend with MongoDB, storing user data and orders. If a user is not signed in, cart items are saved locally using AsyncStorage. The app provides a smooth and modern user experience with dynamic coffee-related data, including detailed product information and sizes.

## Get started

1. make sure you have node.js on your machine

- Node.js: [download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. download yarn incase you want to work with yarn insted of npm (recomended)

   ```bash
   npm install --global yarn
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

## Technologies Used

1. Frontend:

- React Native: For building the mobile app with modern and clean UI/UX.
- Expo: For simplifying development and testing processes, along with Expo Router for navigation.
- TypeScript: To add type safety and improve code quality.
- Zustand: For efficient state management in React Native.
- Async Storage: To handle data persistence for unsigned-in users (e.g., saving cart items).

2. Backend:

- Node.js: For building the server-side of the application.
- Express.js: To manage API endpoints efficiently.
- MongoDB (NoSQL): For database management, storing user data, products, and order history.
- TypeScript: For type safety and consistency in backend code.
- Render.com: For hosting the backend services.

3. Tools: 
- Android Studio: For testing on virtual Android devices.
- Yarn: For managing project dependencies.
